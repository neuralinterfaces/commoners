 The `commoners` CLI allows anyone to build their application as a Progressive Web App (PWA); Mac, Windows, and Linux desktop application; and iOS and Android mobile application—all using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Build Solidarity
At the heart of Commoners is our belief that everyone should be able to write an application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for distribution on all platforms.

We use the term **build solidarity** to indicate the alignment of the world's web developers on a consistent architecture to achieve this goal.

Let's build solidarity together!
