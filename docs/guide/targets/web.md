# Web
Web builds are the default build target. These builds are intended to be deployed to a web server, and are accessible from any device with a web browser.

## PWA
Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that can be installed on a device and accessed from the home screen. PWAs are supported on most modern browsers, and can be installed on both desktop and mobile devicesâ€”though they will have limited access to native features.

Commoners relies on [vite-plugin-pwa](https://github.com/vite-pwa/vite-plugin-pwa) to generate the necessary files for a PWA. To enable this feature, simply add the `--target pwa` flag to your build command.
